# SOFAP-PPT-Generator
My local church uses the Songs of Faith and Praise hymnal. We also use The Paperless Hymnal to put together our PowerPoinnt slides for the service. Rather than manually copying the slides for each individual song and pasting them into one file, and creating slides for prayers and lessons along the way, let's try and automate the process!
